            <p>
            Q42 is a digital agency that creates amazing work. They made an app for blind people to learn mathmatics through sounds or the website of Rijksmuseum is also made by them.
            They make really cool stuff. They had 2 speakers, one talking about accessbility and the second about a digital art experience but still accesible.
            Vasilis called them the best nerd agency. Accessbility is very important for them. The user is the most important part of the website.

              <h2>Inclusive Design & Sense Math</h2>
              <p>
                Sense math changes math to sounds, the app called Visio.
                A connected arc makes a different sound than a straight line.
                the younger, the less detailed. The older, the more detailed.

              <h2>Oculi Mundi - Digital Art Experience</h2>
              <p>This work is about a archive but rather having it stay in a museum, its online virtual 
                for everboy free to see. It's about sharing your artwork with the world, accessible for everyone and
                so is the website as well. The website offers reduced motion, which gives the user the option to stop the 
                motion of objects on the website. You can also navigate through the website with tab on your keyboard.

            <p>
              I thought the office was really cool. They had a match/coffee station and the office was very light with 
              a lot of plants and glass windows. It would be a place where I would like to work. About the talks, they told a lot about 
              the basic Accesbility things which I already knew, but the app Visio with the sounds was very good. They let us guess 3 sounds and 
              it really works so that was really cool. Also the second talk about the digital art experience was a bit in the direction of our 
              archive website for the mastertest, so I wrote some things down to check the website later and I did together with Elton and Sanne.
