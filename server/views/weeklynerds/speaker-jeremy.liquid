            <p>
            Jeremy Keith is, what I later found out, a legend in the CSS world. He has a lot of nolegde about the code 
            languages and the histories. He says that their are 2 ways to handle code: free coding or strict coding. 
            <br>
            He says that their is a distinction between declarative or imperative workplaces and people. 
            You either like to be told what to do or you like to have the freedom. It's all connected to mindset.

            <p>
              If I'm being honest, for a momement during the talk I didn't even know what I was. Was I declaritive or imperative? But then
              someone asked the question:"Can you be both?", and I think that that's me. I'm a bit of both. This talk was very informative because it's important to know
              which one you are. I like to have the freedom, but also not too much. The talk was an eye-opener and I didn't make many notes, only : "which one am I?"
