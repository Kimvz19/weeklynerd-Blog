      <li><p class="intro">
        Framer Framed requested us to rethink and build the ðŸ’» Archive website, which shows the connections of all the exhibitions, work and data collected over the years.
        <br>
        This website is free for the public and accessible for everyone, which jumps to the point of the project. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Archive website needed a make-over to be accessible for everyone (comply with the rules of WCAG guidelines) but also specifically 
        for one target group with a disability, while redesigning how their data was.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="badge-darkpink">Goal 1</p>
            <p>
              Improving the User Experience in the project by applying techniques such as view transitions, better transitions and visually appealing interfaces & consistency.
            </p>

            <p class="badge-white">Elaboration</p>
            <p>
              Agreement with Cyd to use view transitions in the project. After adding new techniques, ask for feedback on visual impact and usability.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="badge-darkpink">Goal 2</p>
            <p>
              Active behaviour, asking questions and ask for help when needed
            </p>

  
            <p class="badge-white">Elaboration</p>
            <p>
              Developing a more active attitude by actively participating in every lesson or meeting, thinking along with questions, understanding all the information. If not, ask a question. Prepare questions for the lesson, maybe check-ins with the teachers, more feedback on code or on the way of working.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p class="badge-darkpink">Goal 3</p>
            <p>
              Out of the box thinking & working. Creative skills improvement with colors, experimenting with techniques, using different coding elements, stepping out of the comfort zone!
            </p>

            <p class="badge-white">Elaboration</p>
            <p>
              Weekly experimenting, trying new color combinations, layouts. Collecting inspiration and trying it out, making mistakes is part of the process.

      <h2> 
        ðŸ‘€ Reflection</h2>
      <p>
       Reflecting on the project, I grew a lot through the whole process, from the concept to the final product. The teamwork was a big positive thing in this project.
       Without our teamwork our project would not be what it is now. I really enjoyed working with my team. The communication was good, we were all responsible and respectfull, we gave each other feedback and we helped each other. 
       <br>
       <br>
       I think my part of the project was my succes of all the information that I absorbed this minor. From the basic form with HTML to CSS styling working with gradients and box-shadows to 
       making the website accessible with WCAG guidelines, clamp, color contrast checking extc.
       <br>
       <br>
       Described in my product Biograph, I'm proud that I successsfully completed my goals for this project. The last weeks were sometimes hard for me,
       because I had to work hard this whole minor but I'm really proud on my process and I would do it all over again!
